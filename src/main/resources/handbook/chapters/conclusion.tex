\section{Conclusion}

After all these steps you should have a good picture of the company and its profitability.
Hopefully you identified the company as a good investment and all you have to do is to
wait for the price to reach the Margin of Safety. This usually only happens when there
is a certain event. This can be a company-specific event, a industry-wide event or a full
recession. Just be patient and wait for the right moment to load up the truck.
