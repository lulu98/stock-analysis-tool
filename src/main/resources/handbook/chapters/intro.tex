\section{Introduction}

The investing strategy is based on a multi-step analysis that increasingly looks
more closely into the company. There will be 5 different phases all together:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Phase 1: First Impression
	\item Phase 2: Management
	\item Phase 3: Moat
	\item Phase 4: Deep Dive (Ratio Analysis)
	\item Phase 5: Intrinsic Value
\end{enumerate}

This multi-step process serve as multiple layers that should protect from naively putting
money into a company that does not deserve your attention. After each step of the
analysis, you should ask yourself if this company is still a company you want to
further research and in the end put money into. With each step, you become more
knowledgeable and in the end should be able to determine if you want to invest into the
company or not.
