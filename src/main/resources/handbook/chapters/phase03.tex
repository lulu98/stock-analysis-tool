\section{Phase 3: Moat}

If a company has a moat this shows in the Big 5 Numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): $\text{ROIC} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}}$
	\item Equity growth rate
	\item Earnings-Per-Share (EPS) growth rate: $\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Earnings}}{\text{Shares}}$
	\item Sales/Revenue growth rate
	\item Free Cash Flow (FCF) growth rate: $FCF = \text{Operating Cash Flow} + \text{CAPEX}$
\end{enumerate}

All of these numbers must be consistently $\geq 10\%$ over the last 10 years. Then
check the 9-/5-/3-/1-year growth rate to an understanding of the direction the
company is going:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{Return after n years} = {(\frac{\text{Current Value}}{\text{Initial Value n years ago}})}^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1$
\end{itemize}
