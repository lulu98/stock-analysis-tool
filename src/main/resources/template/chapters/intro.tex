\section{Introduction}

The investing strategy is based on a multi-step analysis that increasingly looks
more closely into the company. There will be 5 different phases all together:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Phase 1: First Impression
	\item Phase 2: Management
	\item Phase 3: Moat
	\item Phase 4: Deep Dive (Ratio Analysis)
	\item Phase 5: Intrinsic Value
\end{enumerate}
