# SAT-003: Clean up strategy.txt file

## Status

Done

## Description

The strategy.txt file tries to structure stocks according to their industry
and country in a text file format. There is no need for this file, we can simply
put this kind of information, e.g. company name and industry type, into
`src/main/config/stocks.json`.

## Work Log

- Wrote a script that ordered the existing stocks.json list and added to each
  entry the name of the company
- now the strategy.txt file can be deleted
