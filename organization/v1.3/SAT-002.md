# SAT-002: Formalize the project requirements/dependencies

## Status

Done

## Description

Currently the requirements are not formalized at all, but only listed in the
README.md and also not a complete list of all required dependencies. Organize,
formalize and describe the necessary dependencies such that the development
environment becomes reproducable.

## Work Log

- python dependencies:

  ```bash
  python -m pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
  ```

- apt packages:

  ```bash
  cat ./requirements/requirements.apt | xargs sudo apt install -y
  ```

- snap packages:

  ```bash
  cat ./requirements/requirements.snap | xargs sudo snap install
  ```
