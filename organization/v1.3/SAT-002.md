# STA-002: Formalize the project requirements/dependencies

## Status

Done

## Description

Currently the requirements are not formalized at all, but only listed in the
README.md and also not a complete list of all required dependencies. Organize,
formalize and describe the necessary dependencies such that the development
environment becomes reproducable.

## Work Log

- python dependencies:
    * use virtual environment and requirements.txt file: load python modules with `$ python -m pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt`
- apt packages:
    * use requirements.apt file: load packages with `$ cat ./requirements/requirements.apt | xargs sudo apt install -y`
- snap packages:
    * use requirements.snap file: load packages with `$ cat ./requirements/requirements.snap | xargs sudo snap install`
