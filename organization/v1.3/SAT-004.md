# SAT-004: Increase test coverage

## Status

Done

## Description

At the moment, we only have like a third of the code covered in CI. Increase the
test coverage as high as possible.

## Work Log

- unit tests done, the remaining files (`stage01`, `stage02` and `web_api`) are
  ignored
- enforce coverage of over 90 percent
