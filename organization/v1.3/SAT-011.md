# SAT-011: Add integration/system testing

## Status

To Do

## Description

Currently, we only have unit tests. For integration/system tests create their
own Dockerfiles to easily test locally.

Add integration tests (module-wide):

- verify that the correct data is produced and put in the right place

Add system tests (what the user expects):

- verify file hierarchy
- verify that requirements downloading works for snap, apt and pip
- verify that different pipeline stages have the expected behavior
- test all possible interactions with the software
- test that generated PDF files are in right place and have right format
