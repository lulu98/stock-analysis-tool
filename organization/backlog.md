# Backlog

## Automatically rank different stocks based on metrics

- outcome: get list of interesting stocks
- analyze the `calc_data.json` for these companies and create basically grading
system and rank them
- motivation:
    - current state: still have to go through all the companies myself
    - goal: get list of companies ranked by metrics, e.g. each metric gets a
    certain range that is considered good, if company good for metric give 1
    point, otherwise 0 points -> rank the companies by the point -> immediately
    know which companies are financially sound and look into them

## Get information if something happens

- for each company I am interested in, I set a price point, I would be interested
to buy
- plug into real time api, when price goes near that limit -> notify

## Competitor analysis

- compare companies that compete against each other

## Get news and analyze if good or bad

- plug into news api to get news about company and industry -> get informed
whenever this threshold is triggered
- maybe web scrawler
- ML to analyse whether text is good or not
